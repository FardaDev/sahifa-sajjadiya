# Component-Specific Styles

This directory is for component-specific CSS files when Tailwind utility classes aren't sufficient.

## When to use this directory:
- Complex component styles that require multiple CSS rules
- Component-specific animations or transitions
- Styles that are reused across multiple components

## Best Practices:
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes in Blade components
- Only create CSS files here when absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful file names (e.g., `custom-dropdown.css`)
- Document why custom CSS is needed in comments
